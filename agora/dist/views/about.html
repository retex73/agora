It’s not ready to be used for everyday work just yet though and can’t be shared with anyone externally. By testing it out, you can help feed into the next phase and prepare for Agora’s eventual day to day use and external launch. </p> </div> </div> <div class="panel"> <div class="panel-heading"> <div class="panel-title"> Purpose of this document </div> </div> <div class="panel-body"> <p> The purpose of this document is to explain how the Agora reporting system can be used during the phase 1 trial.
